First, topics such as vertebrate origins, zoogeography, taxonomy and comparative methods will be developed as a foundation for inquiry. The remainder of the course will be organized around specific contemporary problems in vertebrate biology such as the evolution of endothermy; feeding strategies and metabolism; locomotion and migration; trends in vertebrate reproduction; evolution of brain size and complexity in relation to cognition and communication. Each problem will be explored through analyses of taxonomic diversity, historical and phylogenetic constraints, physiological and developmental causes, and functional effects.
ZOO*4920 Lab Studies in Ornithology Fall Only (LAB: 3) [0.25]	Restriction(s): This is a Priority Access Course. Enrolment may be restricted to particular programs, specializations or semester levels during certain periods. Please see the departmental website for more information. Instructor consent required.	Prerequisite(s): 14.00 credits including ZOO*2090	This course provides a practical experience in the study of Ornithology. Using University collections of prepared and preserved specimens and field observations where possible, students will develop and apply skills in identification and sampling, explore relations between species diversity and habitat, and investigate, through guided study, the extent of anatomical, skeletal, reproductive and morphological variation and its functional and evolutionary causes.
